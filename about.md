Directions to COM3 are [here](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/about/getting-here/).
For most folks, the easiest to NUS COM3 would be via MRT:

* Take the MRT to Kent Ridge MRT Station (CC24):
* Take Exit A from the station and walk to the bus stop opposite Kent Ridge MRT
* Take internal shuttle bus service D2 from the bus stop opposite Kent Ridge MRT station
* Alight at the third bus stop, COM3

The NUS internal [shuttle bus service](https://uci.nus.edu.sg/campus-life/campus-services/transportation/internal-shuttle-bus/) is free, and does not require an NUS ID. Note that Google maps is not aware of the NUS internal shuttle bus service.
