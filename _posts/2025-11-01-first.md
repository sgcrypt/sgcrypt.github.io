### Abstracts

**<a name="SM"></a>[Public Key Encryption from the MinRank Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03752)**
*Rohit Chatterjee*
We construct a public-key encryption scheme from the hardness of the (planted) MinRank problem over uniformly random instances. This corresponds to the hardness of decoding random linear rank-metric codes. Existing constructions of public-key encryption from such problems require hardness for structured instances arising from the masking of efficiently decodable codes. Central to our construction is the development of a new notion of duality for rank-metric codes. 

**<a name="SM"></a>[Simple and General Counterexamples for Private-Coin Evasive LWE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/374)**
*Surya Mathialagan*

We present a simple counterexample to all known variants of the private-coin evasive learning with errors (LWE) assumption. Unlike prior works, our counterexample is direct, it does not use heavy cryptographic machinery (such as obfuscation or witness encryption), and it applies to all variants of the assumption. Our counterexample can be seen as a "zeroizing" attack against evasive LWE, calling into question the soundness of the underlying design philosophy.
