### Abstracts


**<a name="SM"></a>On Split-State Quantum Tamper Detection**
*Naresh Boddu*

Tamper-detection codes (TDCs) are fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. A TDC encodes messages in such a manner that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output the original message, or reject it. In this work, we study quantum analogs of one of the most well-studied adversarial tampering models: the so-called $t$-split-state tampering model, where the codeword is divided into $t$ shares, and each share is tampered with ``locally". It is impossible to achieve tamper detection in the split-state model using classical codewords. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the situation changes significantly if the message can be encoded into a multipartite quantum state, entangled across the $t$ shares. Concretely, we define a family of quantum TDCs defined on any $t\geq 3$ shares, which can detect arbitrary split-state tampering so long as the adversaries are unentangled, or even limited to a finite amount of pre-shared entanglement. Previously, this was only known in the limit of asymptotically large $t$. As our flagship application, we show how to augment threshold secret sharing schemes with similar tamper-detecting guarantees. We complement our results by establishing connections between quantum TDCs and quantum encryption schemes.

**<a name="SM"></a>Public Key Encryption from the MinRank Problem**
*Rohit Chatterjee*

We construct a public-key encryption scheme from the hardness of the (planted) MinRank problem over uniformly random instances. This corresponds to the hardness of decoding random linear rank-metric codes. Existing constructions of public-key encryption from such problems require hardness for structured instances arising from the masking of efficiently decodable codes. Central to our construction is the development of a new notion of duality for rank-metric codes.

**<a name="SK"></a>Are uncloneable proof and advice states strictly necessary?**
*Srijita Kundu*

Yes, we show that they are.
We initiate the study of languages that necessarily need uncloneable quantum proofs and advice. We define strictly uncloneable versions of the classes QMA, BQP/qpoly and FEQP/qpoly (which is the class of relational problems solvable exactly with polynomial-sized quantum advice). Strictly uncloneable QMA is defined to be the class of languages in QMA that only have uncloneable proofs, i.e., given any family of candidate proof states, a polynomial-time cloning algorithm cannot act on it to produce states that are jointly usable by k separate polynomial-time verifiers, for arbitrary polynomial k. This is a stronger notion of uncloneable proofs and advice than those considered in previous works, which only required the existence of a single family of proof or advice states that are uncloneable. We show that in the quantum oracle model, there exist languages in strictly uncloneable QMA and strictly uncloneable BQP/qpoly. The language in strictly uncloneable QMA also gives a quantum oracle separation between QMA and the class cloneableQMA introduced by Nehoran and Zhandry (2024). We also show without using any oracles that the language, used by Aaronson, Buhrman and Kretschmer (2024) to separate FEQP/qpoly and FBQP/poly, is in strictly uncloneable FEQP/qpoly. 


**<a name="EL"></a>Bootstrapping with RMFE for fully homomorphic encryption**
*Enhui Lim*

 BGV and BFV homomorphic encryption schemes are commonly instantiated using power-of-two cyclotomic orders. Field Instruction Multiple Data (FIMD) was introduced in 2022 to increase packing capacity in the case of small primes, by using reverse multiplication-friendly embeddings (RMFEs) to encode more data into each plaintext slot. However, FIMD did not admit bootstrapping, a core protocol for ensuring ciphertexts can undergo further multiplications.


This talk presents our 2025 work on bootstrapping for RMFE-packed ciphertexts. We first adapt the digit extraction algorithm to work over RMFE-packed ciphertexts, by applying the recode map after every evaluation of the lifting polynomial. To reduce capacity loss, we introduce correction maps to the Halevi-Shoup digit extraction algorithm, to remove all but the final recode of RMFE digit extraction. 


We implement several workflows for bootstrapping RMFE-packed ciphertexts in HElib, and benchmark them against thin bootstrapping for m = 32768. Our experiments show that the basic strategy of recoding multiple times in digit extraction yield better data packing, but result in very low remaining capacity and latencies of up to hundreds of seconds. On the other hand, using correction maps gives up to 6 additional multiplicative depth and brings latencies often below 10 seconds, at the cost of lower packing capacity.


**<a name="SM"></a>SNARGs for NP and Non-Signaling PCPs, Revisited**
*Surya Mathialagan*

We revisit the question of whether one can build succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs) for all of NP under standard assumptions such as the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. Our approach uses non-signaling probabilistically checkable proofs, following the framework of Kalai, Raz, and Rothblum (STOC 2014). In particular, we point out that working with exponential-length PCPs appears to avoid all currently known barriers to such constructions.

Our main result is a candidate non-adaptive SNARG for NP, whose soundness we prove under two assumptions:

1. a standard cryptographic assumption, such as LWE (or alternatives like bilinear-map assumptions), and

2. a mathematical conjecture about multivariate polynomials over the reals.

More precisely, the conjecture gives an upper bound on the minimum total coefficient size of Nullstellensatz proofs—specifically, proofs of membership in a concrete polynomial ideal as studied by Potechin and Zhang (ICALP 2024). Importantly, this conjecture is purely mathematical in nature: it is not a cryptographic or computational hardness assumption.

A particularly notable aspect of our work is that the security analysis makes non-black-box use of the SNARG adversary. This allows us to bypass the black-box barrier of Gentry and Wichs (STOC 2011). As a result, our work offers a blueprint for constructing SNARGs for NP that fall outside the reach of the Gentry–Wichs impossibility framework.

**<a name="KZT"></a>Improved Search-to-Decision Reduction for Random Local Functions**
*Kel Zin Tan*

A random local function defined by a d-ary predicate P is one where each output bit is computed by applying P to d randomly chosen bits of its input. These represent natural distributions of instances for constraint satisfaction problems. They were put forward by Goldreich as candidates for low-complexity one-way functions, and have subsequently been widely studied also as potential pseudo-random generators.

We present a new search-to-decision reduction for random local functions defined by any predicate of constant arity. Given any efficient algorithm that can distinguish, with advantage ϵ, the output of a random local function with m outputs and n inputs from random, our reduction produces an efficient algorithm that can invert such functions with O(m{(n/ϵ)}^2) outputs, succeeding with probability Ω(ϵ). This implies that if a family of local functions is one-way, then a related family with shorter output length is family of pseudo-random generators.

Prior to our work, all such reductions that were known required the predicate to have additional sensitivity properties, whereas our reduction works for any predicate. Our results also generalise to some super-constant values of the arity d, and to noisy predicates. 


**<a name="TY"></a>Quantum Cryptography and Hardness of Non-Collapsing Measurements**
*Takashi Yamakawa*


One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) introduced by Khurana and Tomer [STOC 2024] are a natural quantum analogue of one-way functions (OWFs), and one of the most fundamental primitives in “Microcrypt,” where OWFs do not exist but quantum cryptography is possible. OWPuzzs are implied by almost all quantum cryptographic primitives, and they imply several important applications such as non-interactive commitments and multi-party computations. A significant goal in the field of quantum cryptography is to base OWPuzzs on plausible assumptions that will not imply OWFs.

In this paper, we base OWPuzzs on hardness of non-collapsing measurements. To that end, we introduce a new complexity class called SampPDQP, which is a sampling version of the decision class PDQP introduced in Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee (ITCS 2016). We show that if SampPDQP is hard on average for quantum polynomial time, then OWPuzzs exist. SampPDQP is the class of sampling problems that can be solved by a classical polynomial-time algorithm that can make a single query to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, which is a “magical” oracle that can sample measurement results on quantum states without collapsing the states. Such non-collapsing measurements are highly unphysical operations that should be hard to realize in quantum polynomial time.

We also study upper bounds of the hardness of SampPDQP. We introduce a new primitive, distributional collision-resistant puzzles (dCRPuzzs), which are a natural quantum analogue of distributional collision-resistant hashing (Dubrov and Ishai, STOC 2006). We show that dCRPuzzs imply average-case hardness of SampPDQP (and therefore OWPuzzs as well). We also show that two-message honest-statistically-hiding commitments with classical communication and one-shot signatures (Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, Zhandry, STOC 2020) imply dCRPuzzs.
