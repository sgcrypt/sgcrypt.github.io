### Abstracts

**<a name="SM"></a>[Public Key Encryption from the MinRank Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03752)**
*Rohit Chatterjee*

We construct a public-key encryption scheme from the hardness of the (planted) MinRank problem over uniformly random instances. This corresponds to the hardness of decoding random linear rank-metric codes. Existing constructions of public-key encryption from such problems require hardness for structured instances arising from the masking of efficiently decodable codes. Central to our construction is the development of a new notion of duality for rank-metric codes. 

**<a name="SK"></a>[Are uncloneable proof and advice states strictly necessary?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11827)**
*Srijita Kundu*

Yes, we show that they are.
We initiate the study of languages that necessarily need uncloneable quantum proofs and advice. We define strictly uncloneable versions of the classes QMA, BQP/qpoly and FEQP/qpoly (which is the class of relational problems solvable exactly with polynomial-sized quantum advice). Strictly uncloneable QMA is defined to be the class of languages in QMA that only have uncloneable proofs, i.e., given any family of candidate proof states, a polynomial-time cloning algorithm cannot act on it to produce states that are jointly usable by k separate polynomial-time verifiers, for arbitrary polynomial k. This is a stronger notion of uncloneable proofs and advice than those considered in previous works, which only required the existence of a single family of proof or advice states that are uncloneable. We show that in the quantum oracle model, there exist languages in strictly uncloneable QMA and strictly uncloneable BQP/qpoly. The language in strictly uncloneable QMA also gives a quantum oracle separation between QMA and the class cloneableQMA introduced by Nehoran and Zhandry (2024). We also show without using any oracles that the language, used by Aaronson, Buhrman and Kretschmer (2024) to separate FEQP/qpoly and FBQP/poly, is in strictly uncloneable FEQP/qpoly. 


**<a name="SM"></a>[Simple and General Counterexamples for Private-Coin Evasive LWE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/374)**
*Surya Mathialagan*

We present a simple counterexample to all known variants of the private-coin evasive learning with errors (LWE) assumption. Unlike prior works, our counterexample is direct, it does not use heavy cryptographic machinery (such as obfuscation or witness encryption), and it applies to all variants of the assumption. Our counterexample can be seen as a "zeroizing" attack against evasive LWE, calling into question the soundness of the underlying design philosophy.

**<a name="KZT"></a>[Improved Search-to-Decision Reduction for Random Local Functions](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.02944)**
*Kel Zin Tan*

A random local function defined by a d-ary predicate P is one where each output bit is computed by applying P to d randomly chosen bits of its input. These represent natural distributions of instances for constraint satisfaction problems. They were put forward by Goldreich as candidates for low-complexity one-way functions, and have subsequently been widely studied also as potential pseudo-random generators.

We present a new search-to-decision reduction for random local functions defined by any predicate of constant arity. Given any efficient algorithm that can distinguish, with advantage ϵ, the output of a random local function with m outputs and n inputs from random, our reduction produces an efficient algorithm that can invert such functions with O(m{(n/ϵ)}^2) outputs, succeeding with probability Ω(ϵ). This implies that if a family of local functions is one-way, then a related family with shorter output length is family of pseudo-random generators.

Prior to our work, all such reductions that were known required the predicate to have additional sensitivity properties, whereas our reduction works for any predicate. Our results also generalise to some super-constant values of the arity d, and to noisy predicates.
